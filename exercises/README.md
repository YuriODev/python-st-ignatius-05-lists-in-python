## Exercise 19: Convert Underscore to CamelCase - Medium 🔥 (Est. Time: 10-15 mins | Points: 20)

**Problem:** You decided to write a converter from Python code to Java code. Since Java uses the CamelCase naming standard, you decided to learn how to convert names from underscore to this format. The underscore style is characterized by words in the name being written in lowercase and separated by an underscore `_`. CamelCase means that each word is written with a capital letter and there are no separators between words. Thus, one line is entered containing a name written in underscore format. The program outputs a string containing the name in CamelCase format.

### Input:
- A string in underscore format.

### Output:
- The string converted to CamelCase format.

### Examples:

| No. | Inputs           | Outputs    |

## Exercise 30: Caesar Cipher for Emoji - Hard 🥵 (Est. Time: 15-20 mins | Points: 30)

**Problem:** The task is similar to the Caesar Cipher problem, with one difference: the characters to be encoded are from the `1F600-1F64F` range of the Unicode character table. The encoding is UTF-8. The shift is the same for all characters. The shift is cyclic, meaning if a shift of one is applied to the last character of the alphabet, it will be replaced by the first character, and vice versa. Write a program that encrypts text using the Caesar Cipher. The first line indicates the encryption shift used: an integer. A positive number corresponds to a shift to the right. The second line indicates a non-empty phrase to be encrypted.

## Exercise 37: Decode Run-Length Encoding - Hard 🥵 (Est. Time: 15-20 mins | Points: 30)

**Problem:** Run-length encoding is a basic data compression algorithm. Implement a decoding algorithm for strings encoded using one of the simplest run-length encoding variants. The input to the algorithm is a string containing digits and English alphabet characters. This string is broken down into "runs" (sequences) that are encoded with a number-character pair or simply a character (in which case the number is considered equal to one). The result should contain these runs in the same order they appear in the input string, with each run expanded into the corresponding sequence of characters. For example, the encoded string `3ab4c2CaB` breaks down into runs `3a b 4c 2C a B`, which when expanded, gives the original decoded string `aaabccccCCaB`.

### Input:
- A run-length encoded string.

### Output:
- The decoded string.

### Examples:

| No. | Inputs                | Outputs                       |

Each exercise is designed to challenge different aspects of problem-solving, from simple arithmetic to complex logical reasoning. The estimated completion time for the exercises ranges from 5 minutes for the simplest tasks to 25 minutes for the most complex ones. This gives an average expected time of approximately 10-15 minutes per exercise, depending on the student's prior knowledge and experience.


# Checking Your Score with Autograder 📝

GitHub Classroom's autograder provides immediate feedback on your exercises. Each exercise is worth points based on its complexity, with a total of `90` points available across all exercises. 

When you commit and push your solution, GitHub Actions will run tests on your code. If all tests for an exercise pass, you will be awarded the full points for that exercise. If some tests fail, partial points may be awarded. 

The workflow will run all tests, even if some fail. The total score will be shown in the workflow output as `points scored/total points available`. For example, if you see `10/90`, it means you've successfully completed the first problem worth `10` points.

Please note that the workflow will show as failed if any test fails, even if you've successfully solved some problems. Look for the points tally in the output to see your score.

Remember, practice makes perfect! If you don't pass all tests the first time, review your code, make improvements, and try again. You can push new changes as many times as you need.

# Running Your Code and Tests Locally 🖥️

To run your code and tests locally, you can use the following commands:

1. Run the code:
```bash
python exercises/exercise_1.py
```

2. Run the tests:

To run the tests for an exercise, you'll use the pytest framework. First, make sure you have pytest installed: 

```bash
pip install pytest
```

Then, you can run the tests for a specific exercise using the following command:

```bash
python -m unittest tests/test_exercise_1.py
```

And for more beautiful output, you can use:

```bash
pytest --color=yes -vv tests/test_exercise_1.py
```

or to run only failed test from a specific file:

```bash
pytest --color=yes --failed-first -x tests/test_exercise_1.py
```

Replace `exercise_1` with the exercise you're working on (e.g., `exercise_2`, `exercise_3`, etc.) and `test_exercise_1` with the corresponding test file.
